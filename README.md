```
So baby are you coming home
Should I leave alone
You take my heart and break it
All the time
So baby what do I know?
And how should I feel
When you say you love somebody else
For a lifetime
When I
Looked right in your eyes
Saw my life flash between mine
'Cause I never felt
This before
You don't have to worry
You don't
I have one question
Baby
Can you be?
Mine
Mine
Mine
Can you be?
Mine
Mine
Mine
Can you be?
Mine
Mine
Can you be?
Mine
Mine
Mine
